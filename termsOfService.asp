Color Variations

AmpleWears Brands Group accurately displays the color of each product on this website, to the best of our ability. However, due to color calibration differences between computer displays, we cannot guarantee that the color you see will be an exact color of the product you receive.
Dye Lot Color and Texture

AmpleWears Brands Group matches dye lot colors on all of our products, to the best of our ability. However, there is a chance that slight color shading differences may occur when the same product is ordered at different times. This is likely due to either fabric or ink variations from our supplier, which unfortunately is beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that color shading differences, shape, and or "look and feel" will not occur. If an exact color match, shape and or "look and feel" is required, we suggest that you purchase a sample product(s) before placing a volume order. In the case where the same product is reordered and there is a color difference between the previous and newly ordered product, which is not satisfactory to you, AmpleWears Brands Group will offer a refund or an exchange. However, the customer is responsible for all shipping costs. Lastly, different colored items from the same category will not necessarily look and feel the same.
